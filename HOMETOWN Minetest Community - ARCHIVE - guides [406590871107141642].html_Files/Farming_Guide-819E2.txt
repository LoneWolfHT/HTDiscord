Farming Guide

1. Find somewhere with dirt

2. Dig the area out so it's flat

3. Protect area

4. Dig out channels for water. Or dig an area under the farmland.

5. Fill channels/area under farmland with water (Cover channels with mese lamps if you are building underground or want the plants to grow throughout the night)

6. Choose what you intend to farm in each row. List of available crops will be at the end.

7. Label the rows (Optional)

8. Hoe the rows where you intend to plant your crops. Papyrus, Cactus, and Cocoa don't require tilled soil to grow

9. Plant your crops!

10. Wait for your crops to grow

11. Once your crops have grown go out with a sword (Fastest at digging plants) and harvest them (Removing corn with a lava pick turns it into Corn-on-the-cob)

12. Repeat steps 9 to 11
